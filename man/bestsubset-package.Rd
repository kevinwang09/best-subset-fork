\title{Simulations for best subset selection in regression}
\description{
Tools for running simulations that compare best subset selection in 
  regression to other common sparse regression estimators such as the
  lasso and forward stepwise.
}
\details{
The simulation setup is based on the paper: "Best subset selection via a
  modern optimization lens" by Dimitris Bertsimas, Angela King, and Rahul
  Mazumder, Annals of Statistics, 44(2), 813-852, 2016.
